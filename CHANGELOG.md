## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-29

### Added

- Spatial credential inference engine over xlsx workbooks
- Detection pathways: inline same-cell, spatial-adjacent, split-across-cells, formula-hidden, comment-hidden
- Multilingual password header detection (15+ languages) via Aho-Corasick multi-pattern matching
- Hybrid Arrow/Vec columnar storage backend (`CellStore` with arrow2 immutable columns and Vec workspace)
- Sheet-level parallelism via Rayon (`process_workbook`)
- Shannon entropy computation with bitmask pre-filter (GAP 3)
- BFS region detection with VecDeque (FIX 1 / WIN 1)
- Spatial distance table with pre-computed 7x7 score grid
- Scoring engine with distance, character-class, entropy, region, and context bonuses
- Split-password detection (2-5 cells below header)
- Python API: `gridmap.load()`, `GridDoc`, `Relationship`
- Extraction layer via openpyxl supporting formulas, comments, merged cells, hidden sheets
- PyO3 bindings (`gridmap._core`) with panic-safe FFI boundary
- Criterion benchmark suite with phase-level and sub-phase-level baselines
- 14 synthetic test fixture workbooks covering all detection pathways
- Precision/recall benchmark harness (`bench/harness/run_harness.py`)

### Changed

- Comment merge on duplicate coordinates (FIX 3): merges into existing cell instead of creating duplicates
- Workbook opened once with `data_only=False` (FIX 4): avoids reopening for formula extraction
- Spatial index contains all cells, not just candidates (FIX 2)
- Regex patterns compiled once via `LazyLock` (WIN 3)

### Performance

- Fused `normalize_and_flags()` with ASCII fast path: `precompute_features` -32% (Prompt 18)
- Buffer swap pattern for zero-allocation normalization across cells (Prompt 18)
- `MutableUtf8Array` for incremental Arrow buffer construction in `from_raw`: -3% (Prompt 19)
- End-to-end pipeline improvement: `process_sheet` (5k cells) 1,102 µs -> 927 µs (-16%)
- End-to-end workbook improvement: `process_workbook` (10x5k) 4,402 µs -> 3,330 µs (-24%)

### Internal

- 121 Rust unit tests across 10 modules
- 54 Python tests (unit + integration)
- 100% precision, 100% recall on 14 synthetic fixtures
- Sub-phase profiling infrastructure (`benches/subphases.rs`)
- Deterministic benchmark fixture generator with xorshift32 PRNG
