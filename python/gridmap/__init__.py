"""gridmap --- spatial document graph engine for credential detection.

Detects credentials (passwords, tokens, secrets) stored in xlsx
spreadsheet files by analyzing spatial proximity, content features,
and scoring heuristics. Powered by a Rust core via PyO3.

Quick start::

    import gridmap

    doc = gridmap.load("workbook.xlsx")
    for cred in doc.credentials(min_confidence=120):
        print(f"{cred.key} = {cred.value}")
